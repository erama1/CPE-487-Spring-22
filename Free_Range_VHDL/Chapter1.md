# **Introduction to VHDL**
## VHDL: VHSIC(Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit) HDL(Hardware Description Language)

### - Used to describe hardware, is a con-curerent language
### - Con-current = instructions executed at the same time
### - It's a language ised to implement hardware which will run other software such as 'c'
### - Requires a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) to implement VHDL
